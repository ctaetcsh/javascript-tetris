# Tetris (for vibeOS)
Fork of [jakesgordon/javascript-tetris](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris) for porting into vibeOS. This package uses Webview in vibeOS as it is a web application, but is run locally in vibeOS.

## Modified
Certain files have been removed/modified so that they can be tailored to vibeOS.

## Thanks Jake Gordon
Jake Gordon is the creator behind many of the classic games which have been ported to vibeOS. Plus, he's a fellow Portlander (+10 Kudos). Big Thanks from @ctaetcsh for your amazing work.
